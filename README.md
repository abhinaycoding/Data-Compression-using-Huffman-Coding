## 🧩 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **Data Compression using the Huffman Encoding Algorithm** — one of the most efficient and widely used techniques for lossless data compression.  
It provides a **modern, interactive GUI** that allows users to enter text, visualize frequency tables, generate Huffman codes, and view the encoded and decoded results in real time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- To understand and implement the **Huffman Coding Algorithm** for text compression.  
- To design an **interactive graphical user interface (GUI)** for better visualization and ease of use.  
- To compare the **original and compressed sizes** and calculate the **compression ratio**.  
- To enhance knowledge of **data structures (trees, heaps, and maps)** used in real-world applications.  
- To demonstrate how **lossless compression** works efficiently for character-based data.
